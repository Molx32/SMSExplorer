 # PROJECT NAME

## About
TODO was designed to fecth publicly available SMSs received on Public SMS Services (PSS) platforms. It can be run with two modes : 
- **Passive mode** - SMSs collected are simply stored in a local database, and can be explored in the web interface. 
- **Agressive mode** - When running agressively, an additional process runs and tries to identify if any URL is present in SMSs. If an URL is found, it will try to access it and according to the use case it will result in :
  -  *Access user account compromission* - Information is  PII (Personal Identifiable Information).
  - *Fulfill password reset procedures* - Informations added are login/password.
  - *Collect personal data with no account compromission* - Information is  PII (Personal Identifiable Information).

Is it legal?
- When running passively, yes!
- When running agressively, probably not.
